### About me! ðŸ‘‹

Hello, I am Hubert! I currently a student at the University of California Merced, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). I started off with html for a little and expanding my python knowledge with Machine Learning. Nowadays, I find myself lost in Flutter programming (dart) because UI/UX for app development caught my eye so I am winding down this path inddlging in topics such as FireBase, Bloc, and Clean Architecture(Test Driven Development).
